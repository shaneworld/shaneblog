Welcome!
```

I’m Shane. This is my garden—a place to log things that may seem useless at first glance, yet are quietly fascinating. Here, I share my thoughts, reflections, and moments from daily life, along with notes on programming and technology. I also keep a record of the books I’ve read, or plan to read, in [[books|booklist]], as a way to cultivate a lasting reading habit.

> "Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever." Mahatma Gandhi 

This quote is my personal motto. I’ve always maintained the habit of learning; the continuous process of growth and self-improvement brings me an incomparable sense of joy.

I’m also a Linux enthusiast. My primary machine runs Arch Linux. If you’re interested in installing it yourself, feel free to check out my guide: [[posts/arch-install|Arch Linux Installation Guide]].
